# Task 5 – SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to practice combining data from multiple tables using **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, and **FULL JOIN**.

---

## 🗂️ Database Details
**Database Name:** CustomerOrdersDB

**Tables Created:**
- **Customers** – Stores customer information
- **Orders** – Stores order details linked to customers

Relationship:
- Each order belongs to a customer (linked through `CustomerID`).

---

## 💻 SQL Code Summary
1. **Created Database and Tables**
2. **Inserted Sample Data** into Customers and Orders
3. **Applied JOIN operations**:
   - INNER JOIN
   - LEFT JOIN
   - RIGHT JOIN
   - FULL JOIN (using `UNION` in MySQL)

---
##  Key Concept 
INNER JOIN → Returns only matching rows from both tables.
LEFT JOIN → Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN → Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN → Combines all rows from both tables (MySQL requires UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins).
Joins can be nested and can also be used with more than 2 tables.
FULL JOIN is useful when you need to see all records, matched or not.
