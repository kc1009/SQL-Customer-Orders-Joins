##  Key Concept 
INNER JOIN ‚Üí Returns only matching rows from both tables.
LEFT JOIN ‚Üí Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN ‚Üí Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN ‚Üí Combines all rows from both tables (MySQL requires UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins).
Joins can be nested and can also be used with more than 2 tables.
FULL JOIN is useful when you need to see all records, matched or not.
